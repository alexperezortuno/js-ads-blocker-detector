The code shows how to use the `DOMContentLoaded` event in JavaScript to execute certain actions once the HTML document's DOM has been completely loaded.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Code here is executed after the DOM has fully loaded

  const abd = new AdBlockerDetector({
    instance: true,
    requestTests: [
      'https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js',
      'https://td.doubleclick.net/td/rul/1028889241',
    ],
  });

  abd.start();
});
```

The code utilizes a class called `AdBlockerDetector` to detect if an ad blocker is being used in the browser. An instance of the class is created using `new AdBlockerDetector()` and stored in the variable `abd`.

The `AdBlockerDetector` class requires certain parameters, which are provided through an object with the following properties:

- `instance: true`: This value indicates that an instance of the ad blocker detector is being created.
- `requestTests`: An array of URLs that are used for testing and checking if they are being blocked or not. In this case, two URLs are provided, but you can add more if needed.

Once the instance of the ad blocker detector is created, the `start()` method is invoked to initiate the detection and run the ad blocking tests.

In summary, this code uses the `AdBlockerDetector` class to detect whether the user's browser has an ad blocker enabled. It uses request tests to check if ad load requests are being blocked.

---

A simple alternative way to use the code is as follows:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const abd = new AdBlockerDetector();
});
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simpler usage of the `AdBlockerDetector` class. It still utilizes the `DOMContentLoaded` event to execute the code once the DOM has been fully loaded.

In this version, the `AdBlockerDetector` instance is created without any additional parameters. By default, the class will use internal request tests to check for ad blocking.

Therefore, when the DOM is loaded, a new instance of the `AdBlockerDetector` class is created and stored in the variable `abd`. The ad blocking detection is automatically initiated within the class.

This alternative usage provides a quicker way to set up the ad blocking detection without specifying any custom request tests.
